```
On trust, and what we're changing at GZW Market

Over the past weeks we've heard a lot of concerns about how GZW Market is run —
how we handle data, how our paid tier is structured, and whether reputation on the
platform can be bought. Some of those concerns came in good faith from users. Some
came from other parts of the community. Either way, they deserve a direct response,
not a defensive one.

We got some things wrong in how we presented this app. We want to fix that, clearly
and on the record.

Here's what's true — and what's changing.

1. Your data isn't for sale. It never was. We're proving it instead of just saying it.
We're publishing a plain-language privacy policy this week. It lists exactly what we
collect (email, username, your listings and messages), exactly what we don't (location,
contacts, tracking across other apps), and exactly who can see it (you, moderators for
reports, our database host). We don't sell data. We don't share it with advertisers.
We don't share it with Mad Finger Games.

2. Paid tiers are being rebranded as Supporter, and the free tier stays fully functional.
Core trading will always be free — listing, messaging, trading, rating, Verified Trader
status, LFG. Supporter gives you convenience perks only: higher listing limits, a cosmetic
badge, early feature access. That's it. No reputation boost. No trade priority. No locked
core features. If it affects trust or trading fairness, it's free.

3. Reputation cannot be purchased. We're putting that in writing at signup.
Starting this week, every new account requires a separate, standalone checkbox
acknowledging that Verified Trader status and all reputation are earned through
completed trades only — never purchased. It's not buried in the ToS. It stands alone.
Every user, including those of us building this, agrees to it.

4. We're publishing what this app costs to run — every month.
A new Keep The Lights On page will show our actual monthly infrastructure costs,
itemized, alongside what supporters contributed that month and whether we covered the
bill. If there's a surplus, you'll see what it goes toward. If there's a deficit,
you'll see we ate it. No black box.

5. We're publishing who runs this.
A Built By page with names, roles, and tenures. A Moderator Team page with the same.
No hiding behind a logo.

6. RMT is banned. Permanently. No appeals.
Real money trading is a permanent ban with no appeal. We're writing this into the
Terms of Service and saying it out loud here. If you see RMT on the platform, report
it — we review every report within 48 hours.

7. We're publishing a public roadmap and a public changelog.
You'll see what we're working on, what's planned, what shipped, and every bug we've
fixed. Weekly updates going forward. When we slip a deadline, we'll say we slipped
it and why.

8. We're publishing a quarterly transparency report.
Active users, trades completed, reports handled, bans issued, dollars in, dollars
out. Every three months, publicly.

What we're asking of you

Hold us to this. Bookmark the transparency pages. Call out anything that contradicts
what we've written above. The whole point is that these commitments are verifiable —
if we drift, you should be able to see it and say so.

We're a small team building a free tool for a game we love. We're not Mad Finger
Games. We're not trying to be the only trading app in the community — there's room
for Discord-native tools and there's room for ours. But if you're going to use ours,
you deserve to know exactly how it's run.

All of the above will be live within 30 days. The first-login disclosures, the
Supporter rebrand, and the privacy policy go live this week.

Thanks for the pressure. It made the app better.

— The GZW Market team
